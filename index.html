    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Skillingsboller (skillingsbolle is singular) are basically Norway's take
      on cinnamon buns, and technically these are really specific to Bergen.
    </p>
    <p>
      It translates to “penny bun” (kanelbolle would be “cinnamon bun”, and
      you'll see that all over Norway as well)
