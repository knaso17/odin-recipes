    <p>
      Rømmegrøt is a warmed Norwegian pudding that goes great with a hefty
      drizzle of melted butter and a good sprinkling of cinnamon sugar.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 qt. whole milk</li>
      <li>3/4 c. all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/4 c. sugar</li>
      <li>1/8 tsp. kosher salt</li>
      <li>1/2 c. salted butter, plus more for serving</li>
      <li>cinnamon sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large saucepan over medium heat, heat milk to 195° F. Stir almost
        continuously so milk does not burn, scraping the bottom of the saucepan.
      </li>
      <li>
        While milk is heating, whisk together flour, sugar, and salt in a small
        bowl. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        While milk is heating, melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat.
        Turn off heat and hold until milk has reached 195° F.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once milk temperature has reached 195° F, stir flour mixture into melted
        butter to form a thick paste. Transfer to the heated milk and stir
        constantly until milk starts to boil. Turn heat down to low and let cook
        for 5 minutes more, stirring often. Remove saucepan from heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon into individual bowls and serve with warm melted butter and
        cinnamon sugar (the more, the better!).
