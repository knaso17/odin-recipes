    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Skillingsboller (skillingsbolle is singular) are basically Norway's take
      on cinnamon buns, and technically these are really specific to Bergen.
    </p>
    <p>
      It translates to “penny bun” (kanelbolle would be “cinnamon bun”, and
      you'll see that all over Norway as well)
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>100 grams of granulated sugar (3.5 ounces)</li>
      <li>2 packets of instant yeast (4 1/2 teaspoons)</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon of salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon of cardamom</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon of baking powder</li>
      <li>100 grams of good quality butter (like Kerrygold)</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups of milk (ideally at least 2%, if not full-fat)</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>
        For the spread: butter (about 4 tablespoons?), cinnamon, sugar (I used a
        mixture of white and brown)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix all the dry ingredients (minus cardamom) in a bowl. Put the yeast
        and salt on separate sides of the bowl, because the salt can mess with
        the yeast's ability to activate.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a small saucepan stir together the butter and milk until the butter
        melts, and add the cardamom as well. Heat it up to around 98.6
        degrees---keep a close eye, because you don't want it to boil!
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the milk and butter mixture has cooled a bit (it needs to be at
        least below the 98.6 F temp), add it to the dry ingredients and mix it
        all together. I prefer to do this in my stand mixer and add the liquid
        slowly while the mixer is on low. Put cling wrap over the bowl and let
        it rise at least 30 minutes in a lukewarm place (the dough should
        double; for me this is more like an hour).
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the dough has doubled in size, sprinkle some flour on your counter
        and roll out the dough. It helps to make the dough into a rectangle
        shape to begin with, then use the rolling pin to keep it that way as you
        roll it out decently thin. You can see in my pictures the thickness I
        used---there's no rule for what it should be, I just like a lot of
        filling so wanted thinner dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Soften some butter until it's spreadable and spread onto your rolled-out
        dough. Sprinkle on the cinnamon and sugar to your own taste (I like mind
        to be super gooey), then roll it up. On one of the long sides, tack the
        dough to the counter with your fingers, then start rolling from the
        other side (keeping it long). Try to get a nice, tight roll with no
        gaps. Once it's rolled up, make sure the dough sticks to seal the roll,
        then use a sharp serrated knife or a scraper to cut pieces about 1 inch
        apart.
      </li>
      <li>
        Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and place the dough pieces,
        leaving plenty of spaces between them. Cover with a large plastic bag
        (or kitchen towel) and let them sit in a lukewarm place for about 30-45
        minutes for additional rise. Preheat your oven to 435 F (or 225 C).
        Right before popping them in the oven, mix up a quick egg wash and use a
        pastry brush to add a layer to the top of the buns.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 13-15 minutes, until they are golden on top. Let them rest for
        10-15 minutes after you take them out of the oven before eating.
      </li>
